      "description": "The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.  Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",

The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each. ACS PUMS files for an individual year, such as 2019, contain data on approximately one percent of the United States population.",

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

      "description": "The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",

The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of “72”. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each. The Puerto Rico PUMS file for an individual year, such as 2019, contain data on approximately one percent of the Puerto Rico population.",

Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places.  Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset.   Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets.  The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.  In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g., nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.",

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.    To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

      "description": "Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",

The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a \"PCT\") and 14 housing tables (identified with an \"HCT\") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a \"PCO\") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables.   Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF. See Appendix H, Characteristic Iterations, for more information.",

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw congressional and state legislative districts. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords the states an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.
