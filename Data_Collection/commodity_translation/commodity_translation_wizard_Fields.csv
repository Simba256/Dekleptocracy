"Note: The first and second units of measurement for quantity data vary from year to year in some cases. Dataweb query results always show the most recent units of measure (and there is no adjustment of past year's quantity data). Care should be taken when interpreting quantity data. To view the units of measure for HTS10 subheadings for both import and export codes by year, go to the ""Import concordance"" and ""Export concordance"" sheets, respectively.",,
